# Welcome to my website!

Hi! I'm Vennila Ramasubramanian and I am a first year Epidmemiology + Biostatistics PhD Student at Case Western Reserve University! I recently graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2024 with a B.S. in Computational Biology and a certificate in Global Health. During and after my PhD, I hope to use my computational skills to  address public health problems!
